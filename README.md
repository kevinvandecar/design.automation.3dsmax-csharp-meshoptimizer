## Description

This sample shows how to automate 3ds Max functionality using the Forge Design Automation APIs.

It is built from the base of the learn Forge tutorial.

It has a few components to handle the automation:
 
- .NET Framework plugin for **[3dsMax](ProOptimizerAutomation/)**. It automates setup and configuration of the ProOptimizer plugin. See readme for automation plugin details.
- .NET Core web interface to invoke Design Automation v3 and show results. See [readme](forgesample/) for more information.

The `designautomation.sln` includes the 3ds Max ProOptimizerAutomation bundles and the webapp. The `BUILD` action will copy all files to the bundle folder, generate a .zip and copy to the webapp folder. It requires [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) tool. Additional to that, it will also make a copy to %ProgramData%/Autodesk/ApplicationPlugins for local testing.

You'll need to upload a working item before using the viewer to view the models each time.

NOTE!!!! I moved branches around to make it cleaer which one to use. The default "master" is now the latest and the one deployed as a sample. If you have any clones of this repo, please get a fresh copy. This was done when updating to the 3ds Max 2024 design automation engine.
